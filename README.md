# Hi — I'm Leo 👋  
**:argentina: Argentinian | Based in Tokyo :jp:**  
Aspiring Software Developer  

Currently transitioning from 4 years in **hospitality** to **tech**.  
This October I’m joining the [Le Wagon Tokyo Software Development & AI Bootcamp](https://www.lewagon.com/tokyo) to level up my skills.  

💡 I learn best by **building**. My code isn’t perfect yet, but I’m not afraid to ship, break things, and improve.  
That mindset is what helped me start from scratch, move across the world, and keep growing.

## 🌱 Right now
- Wrapping up **Le Wagon prepwork** (HTML, CSS, Ruby, Javascript, Git)  
- Practicing small projects + notes in repos  
- Getting ready for full-stack and AI projects during bootcamp

## 💪 What I bring
- 4 years of experience in fast-paced, international hospitality roles  
- Strong teamwork, adaptability, and leadership in diverse environments  
- Clear communication across cultures and languages  
- Resilience and a growth mindset — I move forward by learning, improving, and staying consistent
