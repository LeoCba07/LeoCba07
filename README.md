# Hi — I'm Leo 👋  
**:argentina: Argentinian | Based in Tokyo :jp:**  
Junior Software Developer

Transitioning from 4 years in **hospitality** to **tech**.  
Currently undergoing the [Le Wagon Tokyo Software Development & AI Bootcamp](https://www.lewagon.com/tokyo) to level up my skills.  

💡 I learn best by **building**. My code isn’t perfect yet, but I’m not afraid to ship, break things, and improve.  
That mindset is what helped me start from scratch, move across the world, and keep growing.  

---

## 🌱 Right now
- Fully engaged in the intensive Le Wagon Tokyo AI Software Development Bootcamp.
- Mastering full-stack development by building with Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, and the MVC architecture.
- Actively learning to integrate Large Language Models (LLMs) and AI-assisted coding techniques into applications.
- Applying Agile methodologies and Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles to prepare for the final Capstone Project launch in December.
